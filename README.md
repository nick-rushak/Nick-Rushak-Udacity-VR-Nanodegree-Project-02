===================================

# VR Scenes & Objects Course Assets

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

## Versions
- Unity 2017.1.0p5
- GVR Unity SDK v1.70.0

## Project Reflection
- Project completion time: 4hrs
- Something that I really enjoyed about this project was learning about lighting and the complex calculations that involved in creating a light map.
- The one thing that I found challenging (more tedious than challenging) about this project was accurately depicting the passage of time in the form of an animation for the clocks hour, minute and second hands. I suspect this is something better left to scripting in Unity, rather than having a animation that is 86,400 seconds long.
