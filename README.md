## Project Reflection
- Project completion time: 4hrs
- Something that I really enjoyed about this project was learning about lighting and the complex calculations that are involved in creating a light map.
- The one thing that I found challenging (more tedious than challenging) about this project was accurately depicting the passage of time in the form of an animation for the clocks hour, minute and second hands. I suspect this is something better left to scripting in Unity, rather than having a animation that is 86,400 seconds long.
